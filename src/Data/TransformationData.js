Your workout & those conscious changes that you make in your lifestyle, slowly but surely starts showing. And more you appreciate... more you understand your body‚Ä¶ more u love it. It will return all the favors & more. One step at a time I feel I have seen the most changes, late-night shift, work stress & traveling had made me put on weight in no time. Also Lockdown had been the most difficult time, no gym, no friends & no motivation. But that‚Äôs the time I have seen the most changes. I feel so healthy, strong & happier than before. @tilak & @Anoop thank you for being there as I inch towards my new goals. Starting Weight:76kgs. Current Weight:66kgs. It‚Äôs been an incredible journey with training & nutritional guidance from the best coaches @tilak_ramachandra & @anoop_28_ . Excited for the journey ahead as well."',

As I crossed my teens I started to face fatigue, binge eating, lethargy and most of all weight gainü•∫ I almost gained 11 kgs in one year and my clothes almost didn‚Äôt fit meüòñ I just could not take it so I wanted to do something to get back to my normal body. That is when I consulted a dietician because I knew I had to diet and eat right but didn‚Äôt know how to do it. So even the life during weight loss stage was not rosy.. I‚Äôve cried sometimes for not being able to eat sweets or binge on something. So after 6 to 7 months of eating right I lost 10 kgs. I was 64.7 and I came down to 52.4 kgs to be precise. So after loosing 10 kgs my skin kind off become saggy which is usual for any person who undergoes weight loss. That‚Äôs when I joined sweat school for toning up and getting in shape. This place changed me completely and the journey of love for fitness hasn‚Äôt stopped‚ò∫Ô∏è and it‚Äôs something that I cherish!! I cannot live without working out now."',

After about 4 to 5 months , I started feeling better anxiety wise but I had gained more than 15 kgs in this period.I remember Tilak telling us why its important to eat healthy and workout regularly. So I decided to follow his suggested routine , initially I couldnt do much due to my job schedule. Then the Pandemic hit and the online era began. I joined Sweat School (Headed by Tilak and Anoop)and got all required workout routines and nutrition advices from them. I noticed my breathing and sleeping pattern getting better , I surely wasnt lazy anymore and I broke my record of not checking my weight for 5 months (due to the fear of it being too much) and to my surprise I had reduced 10 to 11 kgs approximately. This was such a motivation to me to continue!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"',
